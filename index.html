		<h1>Arrays in <img src="https://github.com/isocpp/logos/raw/master/cpp_logo.svg"></h1>

		<p>Arrays in C++ cannot be extended or shrunk.  This means that no matter what you do, you cannot add or remove elements from it without just recreating the whole array.</p>

		<p><code>int arr[] = {<span style="background-image: url('media/bars.gif')">3, 5, 56, 12, 9</span>};</code></p>

		<p>Due to this, 90% of use cases are better solved with vectors, at least for humans coding.  Arrays still have their uses in the backend for uses that you may never see.  For example, the <code>string</code> type is actually an array of <code>char</code> types, like such:</p>

		<p><code>char s[] = {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd'};</code></p>

		<p>However, while the length of an array may not change, the elements inside it can by using an index.</p>

		<pre>
	arr[0] = 7;
	arr[2] = 79;
	arr[3] = 54;

	int arr[] = {<span class="array no-print">3</span><span class="array arralt1">7</span>, 5, <span class="array no-print">56</span><span class="array arralt2">79</span>, <span class="array no-print">12</span><span class="array arralt2">54</span>, 9};</pre>

		<h1>Vectors in <img src="https://github.com/isocpp/logos/raw/master/cpp_logo.svg"></h1>

		<p>Vectors in C++ behave almost the exact same as arrays but with the crucial difference that they can have elements added and taken away.</p>

		<pre>
	vector&ltint&gt v;

	v.push_back(5);
	v.push_back(24);
	v.push_back(12);
	vector&ltint& v = {<span class="push-back pushalt1">5, </span><span class="push-back pushalt2">24, </span><span class="push-back pushalt3">12</span><span class="push-back pushalt4">};</span></pre>

		<p>Vectors also have many more functions associated with them, such as the <code>push_back()</code> shown above that adds an element to the end of a vector, <code>pop_back()</code> to remove the element at the end of a vector, and <code>size()</code> to give exactly how many elements there are.

		<pre>
	v.size();
	vector&ltint&gt v = {
		5,	<span class="vector-size vectalt1">//1</span>
		24,	<span class="vector-size vectalt2">//2</span>
		12	<span class="vector-size vectalt3">//3</span>
	};

	// Returns 3</pre>

		<h1>For Loops in <img src="https://github.com/isocpp/logos/raw/master/cpp_logo.svg"></h1>

		<p>For loops are a control flow function allowing you to repeat a line of code for a certain number of times, such as this one which repeats 3 times.</p>

		<pre>
	for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		write_line("Hello, World!");
	}</pre>

		<pre>
	// Returns
	&gt <span class="for-loop foralt1">Hello, World!</span>
	&gt <span class="for-loop foralt2">Hello, World!</span>
	&gt <span class="for-loop foralt3">Hello, World!</span>
	</pre>

		<p>However their main use is to iterate through data so you don't have to re-use code and can be more flexible with your data, such as being able to work through every element in a vector, no matter the size.</p>

		<pre>
	vector&ltstring&gt v = {"Hello,", "World", "!"}

	for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
		write_line(v[i]);
	}</pre>

		<pre>
	// Returns
	&gt <span class="for-loop foralt1">Hello,</span>
	&gt <span class="for-loop foralt2">World</span>
	&gt <span class="for-loop foralt3">!</span>
	</pre>

		<p></p>
